The point of this project was to find what password matched the hashed password and output what password matched what hash. I set it up so that it opens two files the txt file contiaining all the different passwords and the txt with the hashes I was attempting to decrypt. After that it puts the contents of the files into two empty arrays and seaches each array for matches. After it finds the matches it prints them out.
